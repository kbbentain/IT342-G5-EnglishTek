## Short Description About Myself:
Hi, I'm Kenjie Bentain, a third-year BSIT student currently living in Carmen, Toledo City. 
I have a passion for video games and often immerse myself in virtual worlds during my downtime. 
I cherish spending time with friends, whether we're gaming together or exploring new places. 
I also enjoy solo adventures where I can unwind and discover new experiences on my own. 
Food is a major part of my life; I love trying different cuisines and going on food trips to satisfy my culinary curiosity. 
Balancing academics with my hobbies keeps me energized and excited about each day!
