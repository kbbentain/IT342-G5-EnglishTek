<Short Description about yourself (5 sentences)>

<p> Hi, I'm Kenjie Bentain, a 3rd-year BSIT student currently living in Carmen, Toledo City. I am kind in action but harsh in thinking. I spend most of my time playing online games and listening to music. Every Saturday, I practice my bass guitar skills. My dream job is to become a Quality Assurance specialist. </p>
