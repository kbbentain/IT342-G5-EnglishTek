<short description about yourself (5 sentences)>

```sh
I'm a third-year college student with a passion for video games, often immersing myself in virtual worlds during my downtime. 
I cherish spending time with friends, whether we're gaming together or exploring new places. 
I also enjoy solo adventures, where I can unwind and discover new experiences on my own. 
Food is a major part of my life; I love trying different cuisines and going on food trips to satisfy my culinary curiosity. 
Balancing academics with my hobbies keeps me energized and excited about each day!
